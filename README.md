## My process

I began by building a semantic HTML structure to contain the QR code, heading, and supporting paragraph. This provided a solid foundation for the layout.
I moved on to styling with CSS. I applied a CSS reset using the universal selector (* { margin: 0; padding: 0; }) to ensure consistent spacing across browsers. For the main layout, I styled the body using Flexbox.The .outer-box and .card classes were used to structure the component.
For responsiveness and visual consistency, the image was styled to fit its container fully (width: 100%) and given rounded corners with border-radius. 
Overall, I aimed for a centered layout with clean design principles using only HTML and CSS.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox



### What I learned

In this project, I learned how to import fonts from Google Fonts and use them in my design. I also got good practice using basic HTML and CSS. It helped me understand how to structure a page and style it using Flexbox to center content and create a clean layout. As a beginner, this was a great way to apply what Iâ€™ve been learning.

### Continued development

I'm still learning and getting more comfortable with using Flexbox. In future projects, I want to focus more on how to use Flexbox effectively for different layouts. I also plan to keep practicing CSS techniques to improve my styling skills and build more responsive designs.
